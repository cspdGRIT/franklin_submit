# Detailed Explanation of Loan Default Prediction Code

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the code used for predicting loan defaults using various machine learning models. The code encompasses data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and generating insights.

## Overview

The code begins by importing necessary libraries and suppressing warnings to ensure cleaner output. It then loads the datasets containing loan information and mappings for column names, making the data more interpretable.

## Data Loading and Preparation

The datasets are loaded from CSV files. The main dataset contains details about loans, while a mapping file is used to rename columns for better clarity. A dictionary is created from this mapping, and the columns in the main dataset are renamed accordingly.

## Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

A function is defined to convert percentage strings (e.g., "50%") into float values (e.g., 0.50). This is crucial for numerical analysis. The code also converts specified date columns into datetime format for easier manipulation and creates a new feature that calculates the number of years since the borrower's earliest credit line was opened.

After creating this new feature, the original date columns are dropped to streamline the dataset. Additionally, percentage columns are converted using the previously defined function to ensure all values are in a usable format.

## Handling Missing Values

The code checks for the presence of a target variable (`loan_status`). If it is missing, another column is renamed to serve as the target variable. Numeric columns are identified, and any columns with all missing values are removed. Missing values in numeric columns are then imputed using median values to maintain data integrity.

## Encoding Categorical Variables

Categorical variables are encoded into numerical values using `LabelEncoder`. This transformation allows machine learning models to process these features effectively.

## Splitting Data

The dataset is split into features (inputs) and the target variable (output). The features are separated from the target variable, and then the data is divided into training and testing sets using an 80/20 split. This ensures that we can evaluate model performance on unseen data.

## Model Initialization

A variety of machine learning models are initialized for comparison purposes. These include Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, Bagging Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, LightGBM Classifier, and CatBoost Classifier.

## Model Evaluation Function

A function is defined to fit each model on the training data and evaluate its performance on the test data. This function includes a timeout feature to prevent long-running processes from hanging indefinitely. Various performance metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, ROC AUC score, and F1 score are calculated and printed for each model.

## Preprocessing Pipelines

To streamline preprocessing for numeric and categorical features, pipelines are created. Numeric features undergo median imputation followed by scaling. Categorical features are imputed with the most frequent value and one-hot encoded. A `ColumnTransformer` combines these pipelines for efficient processing.

## Applying Preprocessing

The preprocessing pipelines are applied to both training and testing datasets. The results can be converted back into DataFrames for better interpretability.

## Evaluating Models

Each model is evaluated on the preprocessed data. A specific timeout is applied when evaluating KNN due to its computational intensity. The evaluation function is called for each model to print various performance metrics.

## Explainable AI with SHAP

SHAP values are calculated for one of the models (e.g., Random Forest) to explain its predictions. A summary plot visualizes feature importance across predictions, helping stakeholders understand which features influence model decisions.

## Predicting Missing Loan Statuses

Finally, predictions are made on rows where `loan_status` is missing. These predictions are stored in an Excel file named `LoanStatusPredictions.xlsx`, providing a convenient way to review predicted statuses.
